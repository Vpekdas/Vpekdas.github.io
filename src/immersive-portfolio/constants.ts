            "First game development project during the 42 common core. The purpose was to learn how to use a simple graphical library in C. I made a 2D platformer and learned all my basics for game development here. (The poster resembles a pixel art game, which is why I included it here.)",

            "This project taught me how to multithread a simple program, still written in C. The purpose was to simulate the dining philosophers problem and make them last as long as possible by efficiently managing their forks (mutexes in programming terms).

            "First big group project. The purpose was to create a small shell similar to Bash. It handles some built-in commands and basic inputs. It seemed scary at first, but not so much once it's behind you. (It's a sink because 'shell' reminds me of seashells, and C shell, get the joke?)",

I created plenty of prototypes. My journey as a game developer probably began here. (It's shown on a computer because I spent most of my time programming on one.)",

            "First actual C++ project. Unfortunately, it was done in C++98, but it was still a great opportunity to learn the basics and discover new features and concepts. The idea was to try to replicate some features of Nginx and create a basic web server. You can open your browser and try requesting some static pages.

So I chose C++20, OpenGL, and SDL, as I heard they were the easiest for learning graphical programming.
