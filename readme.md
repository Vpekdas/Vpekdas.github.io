## Description

Hello! This is my first portfolio project, built using JavaScript and hosted on GitHub Pages. You can "Play" it by clicking here [Portfolio](https://vpekdas.github.io/)

### Purpose

This project showcases some of my 42 Common Core projects. You can explore them in a more interactive way, as the portfolio is designed to look and feel like a 2D game. It might also inspire you to create your own 2D portfolio using only JavaScript!

### Technologies used

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Kaboom.js
- Vite

### Challenges and Future Features

This was my first time coding in JavaScript, which felt a bit strange at first especially coming from typed language like C. I had to learn how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS, as well as how to work with the Kaboom.js library to bring the 2D game-like experience to life. Each feature I wanted to implement came with its own challenges and took varying amounts of time to figure out.

I'm not planning to add more content or features to this version.

## Credits

I learned JavaScript by myself while working on this project, but I was inspired by [JSLegend](https://github.com/JSLegendDev) and his excellent [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy_fSStEgMs&t=349s).
