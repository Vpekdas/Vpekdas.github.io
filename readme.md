## Description

Hello! This is my interactive portfolio website that showcases my development journey and projects. 

### Purpose

I wanted to learn web development and build a cool portfolio that showcases my passion for coding and experimenting with new technologies. 

- **Started with the basics:** Learned JavaScript and built the first version with vanilla JS.
- **Added interactivity:** Integrated KAPLAY to create an immersive portfolio.
- **Expanded my skills:** Learned TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS.
  
### Technologies Used

- **TypeScript** : For type-safe JavaScript development
- **React** : Frontend framework for building interactive user interfaces
- **TailwindCSS** : Utility-first CSS framework for responsive styling
- **KaPlay** : Game library

### Challenges and Future Features

The main challenges in this project were learning JavaScript fundamentals and HTML interaction. Then I had to understand how CSS works for styling. After that, I learned how to use Kaboom.js for game development.

After a long moment, migrating to TypeScript was challenging because of the typing system. Most of all, understanding how React works with its component system and hooks was the biggest difficulty.

## Credits

I learned all the technologies used in this project through self-study, but I was inspired by [JSLegend](https://github.com/JSLegendDev) and his excellent [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy_fSStEgMs&t=349s).
